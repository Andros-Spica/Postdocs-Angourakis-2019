**Abstract**  
The intersection between videogames and simulation models in archaeology, have a still widely unexplored potential for advancing in both public engagement and research methodology. More specifically, there could be a mutually-beneficial connection between archaeological agent-based simulation models (ABMs), created by and for archaeologists, and video games. The ABM community in archaeology can use videogames as heuristic tools for documenting, exploring, sharing, and improving their models, while game developers would find that archaeological ABMs can be powerful tools for generating dynamics that are informed by archaeological research. I will present a side-project in collaboration with Shawn Graham (Carleton University) to develop a proof-of-concept: a first-person, open-world videogame based one of the first and most influential ABMs in archaeology, the ‘Artificial Anasazi’ model. I will overview our consolidated game design and story, commenting on the caveats and opportunities of using ABM models for creating feasible and attractive video games. The game is under development and remains unfinished and unpublished. However, we are committed to open sharing and collaboration with both archaeological and game development community.
